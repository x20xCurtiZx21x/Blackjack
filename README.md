# Blackjack(21)
Blackjack is a popular casino game played by many.
The objective of the game is to draw cards that add up to or as close to 21 without going over 21.
If you obtain a closer number to 21 than the dealer, you win!
I recreated this game in Python for Singleplayer mode and easier accessibility whenever I don't have playing cards on hand

## Motivation
I wrote the code in my free time in order to apply the skills I am currently developing in my studies.
